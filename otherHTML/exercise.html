                When it comes to exercise, the physical benefits are well-documented, 
                from lowering blood pressure and your risk of some diseases to improving your physical appearance.
                Increasingly, the spotlight is being shone on the mental health benefits of working out, such as boosting 
                your mood, improving sleep and easing symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.
            </p>

            <p>
                Science backs this up. One study found that increasing your activity levels from doing nothing, 
                to exercising at least three times a week, reduces the risk of depression by up to 30 per cent. 
                Another study found that individuals who engaged in exercise had 43% lower self-reported 'poor mental 
                health' days than those who did not.

                            ​Engaging in activities like running and walking significantly benefits mental health by releasing endorphins and serotonin, chemicals that can enhance mood and alleviate stress. Regular participation in these exercises has been linked to reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety, improved memory, and better learning abilities. Additionally, incorporating such physical activities into your routine can lead to improved sleep quality, further supporting mental well-being. ​

                        <p>
                            Pilates is beneficial for mental health because it emphasizes mindful movement, focused breathing, and body awareness, which help reduce stress and anxiety. This mind-body connection encourages relaxation and helps individuals develop a more balanced perspective on life's challenges. By improving posture, flexibility, and overall body strength, Pilates also promotes a sense of accomplishment, contributing to a positive mental state.

                            Swimming promotes mental health by releasing endorphins, natural chemicals that enhance mood and alleviate stress. The rhythmic movements and controlled breathing in swimming resemble meditation, contributing to relaxation and reduced anxiety. Additionally, swimming lowers cortisol levels, the body's stress hormone, further aiding in stress management.

                            Cycling enhances mental health by releasing endorphins, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, which improve mood and alleviate stress. It also promotes better sleep by regulating circadian rhythms and reducing stress hormone levels. Additionally, cycling stimulates the growth of new brain cells responsible for memory, enhances creative thinking, and fosters feelings of calm and well-being.

                        <h2>Boxing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Engaging in non-contact boxing can significantly enhance mental health by providing a cathartic release of anger and stress, leading to improved mood and self-esteem. Studies have shown that such boxing interventions can reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Additionally, participants often experience increased confidence, concentration, and overall well-being.
